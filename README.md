# Five Elements

Just a mini 2D game that made by me. Although this game is not very professional, I want to share it with you since I have used a little bit of time to make it.

Because I won't use it for commercial. Therefore, all the codes are open source. However, I am still a junior programmer so all the code may not the best and optimized.

Hopefully, you will find it useful.
